# Walmart Smart Picks
This project deep dives in analyzing the spending behavior of Walmart customers through comprehensive data analysis.
Using techniques like outlier detection, confidence interval calculations (CLT and bootstrapping), and demographic analysis (gender, age, marital status), key patterns in customer behavior were identified.
The analysis was conducted using Python libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. 
Actionable recommendations were developed to enhance customer insights and business strategy.
